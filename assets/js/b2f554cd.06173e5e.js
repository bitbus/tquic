It offers several enhancements, aiming to eventually replace TCP, which could enable Internet transport to continue evolving and solve many of the problems plaguing the Internet. \\n\\nWith QUIC being chosen as the foundation for HTTP/3, it is reasonable to expect that the protocol will carry a significantly larger share of Internet traffic.\\n\\nGiven QUIC\'s broad scope, long-term vision, and innovative nature, we have decided to release our TQUIC library as open-source. Our goal is to take use of this opportunity to collaborate with peers and further advancements in transport layer technology.\\n\\n\\n# Features and Advantages\\n\\nThe advantages of TQUIC are as follows.\\t\\n\\n**High Throughput**: TQUIC provides the most comprehensive collection of congestion control algorithms in the industry, consistently meeting RFC standards and outperforming similar open-source projects by 2%-30% on weak networks and in specific scenarios.\\n\\n**High performance**: The performance of TQUIC surpasses that of similar open-source projects by 5% in most test scenarios, and by 20% in some scenarios.\\n\\n**High Quality**: The QUIC protocol stack comprises over 10 core RFC standards or drafts, covering the transport layer, security layer, and application layer. It is considerably more complex compared to TCP. TQUIC has achieved an impressive unit test coverage of over 95% and has successfully passed interoperability tests with four leading QUIC implementations in the industry. Additionally, a rigorous test method based on formal specifications (SIGCOMM2019 paper) is employed to ensure strict protocol conformance.\\n\\n**Easy to Use**: TQUIC is easy to use, supporting flexible configuration and detailed observability. It offers APIs for Rust/C/C++ and plans to extend support Kotlin/Swift, etc.\\n\\n**Powered by Rust**: TQUIC is written in a memory-safe language, making it immune to Buffer Overflow vulnerability and other memory-related bugs.\\n\\n**Rich Features**: TQUIC supports all big features conforming with QUIC, HTTP/3 RFCs.\\n\\n[The TQUIC project website](https://tquic.net/docs/intro) offers a comprehensive introduction to TQUIC.\\n\\n\\n# Architecture\\n\\nThe illustration below displays the TQUIC architecture.\\n\\n![TQUIC Architecture](./tquic-arch.png)\\n\\nTQUIC was designed with cross-platform compatibility and support for multiply concurrency models as its key goals. The TQUIC core employs an abstraction design for network I/O and event loop, and it doesn\'t rely on sockets, but rather user-provided callbacks. Furthermore, the TQUIC core doesn\'t impose specific event loop requirements; instead, it offers functions to assist users in scheduling events. This flexibility makes TQUIC easy to customize and integrate into various systems.\\n\\nThe TQUIC API layer provides user-friendly interfaces for programming languages on mainstream platforms. It offers both synchronous and asynchronous semantic interfaces, compatible with various concurrency models, and streamlining user experience.\\n\\n\\n# Roadmap\\n\\n* Integrating open-source ecosystem projects, expanding TQUIC application scenarios, and further enhancing user experience with TQUIC\\n* Publishing relevant papers and gradually releasing more advanced TQUIC features and algorithms as open-source\\n* Tracking the evolution and innovation of the QUIC protocol, while continuously enhancing the core capabilities of TQUIC\\n\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nThe open source of TQUIC is just the beginning. We welcome suggestions from all parties and encourage involvement in the advancement of the ecology of transport technology. Interested parties are welcome to reach out and engage with us."}]}')}}]);
